    <section>
        <p>Travel spending patterns offer fascinating insights into the priorities and financial situations of different demographic groups. Our analysis of Danish travel spending data reveals striking differences in how various segments of Danish society budget for their vacations and trips.</p>
        
        <p>Looking at three key spending categories—travel packages, restaurant dining, and accommodation—we can observe distinct patterns that reflect both financial capacity and travel preferences among Danes.</p>

        <h2>Travel Budget Distribution by Demographic Group</h2>
        <p>The visualization below shows how different demographic groups in Denmark allocate their travel spending across three major categories. The radar chart format makes it easy to compare the spending patterns and priorities of each group.</p>

        <h2>Key Findings from the Danish Travel Budget Analysis</h2>
        <p>Our analysis reveals several notable patterns in how different Danish demographic groups approach travel budgeting:</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <div class="highlight-title">Restaurant Spending Dominates Across All Groups</div>
            <p>For every demographic group analyzed, restaurant spending represents the largest portion of travel budgets. This highlights the importance of culinary experiences in Danish travel culture, regardless of income level or life situation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <div class="highlight-title">High-Income Earners Focus on Premium Experiences</div>
            <p>High-income Danes spend significantly more on restaurants (24,289 DKK) and travel packages (7,628 DKK) than other groups, suggesting a preference for premium dining experiences and convenience-oriented travel solutions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <div class="highlight-title">Surprising Accommodation Spending Among Unemployed</div>
            <p>One of the most unexpected findings is that unemployed Danes allocate the highest amount to accommodation (11,420 DKK) among all groups, significantly higher than the average household. This might indicate longer stays, potentially combining job searching with travel.</p>

        <h2>Understanding the Travel Budget Distribution</h2>
        <p>The data reveals intriguing patterns in how different Danish demographic groups approach travel spending:</p>
        
        <div class="insight-grid">
            <div class="insight-card">
                <h3>High-Income Earners</h3>
                <p>With a total travel budget of 41,489 DKK, high-income earners spend the most overall, with a strong emphasis on restaurant experiences (58.5% of total spending). They also invest significantly in travel packages, suggesting a preference for premium, all-inclusive travel experiences.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="insight-card">
                <h3>Self-Employed</h3>
                <p>Self-employed Danes have the second-highest travel budget (33,050 DKK) and allocate a surprising 30.6% to accommodation, the highest proportion among all groups except the unemployed. This might reflect longer work-related stays or a preference for higher-quality lodging.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="insight-card">
                <h3>Unemployed</h3>
                <p>Despite having limited income, unemployed Danes allocate significant funds to travel (28,090 DKK in total), with 40.7% going to accommodation—the highest proportion of any group. This unexpected pattern may indicate extended travel periods or different accommodation priorities.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="insight-card">
                <h3>Students</h3>
                <p>Students maintain the most balanced spending profile while having among the lowest total budgets (15,426 DKK). Restaurant spending still dominates at 74.3%, with minimal investment in travel packages (10.8%) and accommodation (14.9%), reflecting budget-conscious travel choices.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>The variation in spending patterns reflects not just financial capacity but fundamentally different approaches to travel. While high-income earners focus on premium dining and comprehensive travel packages, other groups like the unemployed prioritize accommodation, potentially extending their stays to maximize travel value.</p>

        <h2>Methodology Note</h2>
        <p>This analysis is based on comprehensive travel budget data collected from various Danish demographic groups. All figures are reported in Danish Kroner (DKK) and represent average annual spending per household within each category. The three main spending categories analyzed are travel packages (organized tours and package holidays), restaurants (dining out during travel), and accommodation (hotels, rentals, and other lodging expenses).</p>
