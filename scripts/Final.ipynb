    "## 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is your dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "We're analyzing Danish tourism patterns using data from multiple sources, which all are provided below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Danish Tourism Statistics** (Statistics Denmark - Statistik Banken)\n",
    "   - Demographics data: Socioeconomic (FU14), Regional (FU17), Age (FU18): https://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?MainTable=FU14&PLanguage=0&PXSId=0&wsid=cftree\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Air Travel Comparisons**\n",
    "   - World Bank tourism data: https://databank.worldbank.org/id/7ad54403\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Global Reference Data**\n",
    "   - TripAdvisor Restaurants (31 European cities): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/damienbeneschi/krakow-ta-restaurans-data-raw/code\n",
    "   - Global Peace Index (GPI): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/natalyreguer in/global-peace-index-gpi\n",
    "   - Cost of Living Index: https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp\n",
    "   - Mean Temperature by Country: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/palinatx/mean-temperature-for-countries-by-year-2014-2022?select=combined_temperature.csv\n",
    "   - CO2 Emissions: https://flightemissionmap.org/#Copenhagen/55.67,12.57/127/20000\n",
    "\n",
    "The Danish data covers demographics with detailed stats on who travels and how much they spend. The global data helps understand why Danes choose certain destinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why did you choose these datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to answer questions like:\n",
    "- How has Danish tourism changed over time?\n",
    "- What factors make destinations popular?\n",
    "- Do different demographics travel differently?\n",
    "- And just in general get as much informations about travelling, with focus on danes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We combined government statistics with global data to get both local patterns and international context. The idea was to create something that helps people understand Danish travel trends and maybe plan their own trips.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What was your goal for the end user's experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal for the end user is that they are able to see how Danish tourism has evolved, Compare countries on different metrics, Explore demographic patterns and in the end be able to make informed travel decisions, and find out where the next travel destination should be.\n",
    "We went for a magazine-style design that guides users through key insights but also lets them explore freely."

    "## 5. Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "We selected four main visualizations that work together to tell the story of Danish tourism from different angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bubble chart shows Denmark's tourism journey from 1996 to 2019, with GDP on a log scale on the x-axis and tourism departures per capita on the y-axis. The bubble size represents population, and the animation progresses year by year. We marked Denmark with a star to make it easy to follow throughout the animation. This visualization was chosen because it shows Denmark's relative position in global tourism evolution - you can see how we've grown compared to other countries while our economy has developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choropleth map displays eight different metrics that influence destination choices. Users can switch between factors like cost of living, safety, temperature, and CO2 emissions. Each country is color-coded based on the selected metric, and hovering reveals detailed data. We added restaurant markers for major European cities to provide local context. This map enables direct comparison of potential destinations across multiple factors, making the decision-making process transparent for travelers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For demographic analysis, we created three radar charts comparing spending patterns across socioeconomic groups, age ranges, and regions. All three use normalized scales to ensure fair comparison between categories like package holidays, restaurants, and accommodation. The color coding remains consistent to make patterns easier to spot. These charts reveal how different Danish demographics approach travel spending in an intuitive format that shows relative proportions clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the correlation heatmap shows relationships between all destination factors. It uses a red-blue color scale where red indicates negative correlation and blue shows positive. All correlation values are displayed numerically for precision. This visualization provides quantitative evidence for what influences destination preferences, supporting data-driven decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four visualizations complement each other perfectly. The bubble chart establishes Denmark's global context and growth story. The choropleth map empowers users to select destinations based on their preferences. The radar charts reveal demographic insights for personalization. And the correlation heatmap validates the relationships between factors. Together, they create a comprehensive toolkit for understanding Danish tourism from historical, geographic, demographic, and analytical perspectives."
