In this section, we explore how Danish travelers get to their destinations, both within Denmark and abroad. Through interactive visualizations, we uncover how preferences shift between domestic and international travel, and how external factors like the COVID-19 pandemic have shaped these trends over time.

## Trains, Planes or Highway Lanes?

When it comes to traveling, the mode of transport people choose reveals more than just practical preferences—it can also provide valuable insights into their behaviors, attitudes, and even cultural tendencies. This visualization explores the transportation choices Danes make for both local and international travel, helping to highlight how preferences shift depending on the destination. By switching between domestic and international vacation options in the dropdown menu on the left you can uncover how transportation choices shift.

Looking at Danish travelers with a destination outside of Denmark, airplanes have dominated as the prefered type of transport for vacation travel, consistently accounting for over 3 million international vacations annually during the 2017-2019 period. While air travel saw a significant drop in 2020-2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the trend shows a strong recovery in 2022-2023, approaching pre-pandemic numbers. The visualization reveals that Danes prefer to fly abroad, though a substantial portion still prefers the flexibility of ground transportation even for international journeys.

When Danes vacation within Denmark itself, the picture changes dramatically. Danish vacationers overwhelmingly prefer cars for domestic getaways which does makes sense given Denmark's size, road infrastructure and high rate of car ownership. The total domestic vacation travels is overall consistent at around 2,5 mio vacations per year but peaks in 2020 with a spike in 2021, probably as a result of the restrictions on international travels during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

## Danes on Planes

We now know that Danes have a clear preference for flying when traveling internationally, but what drives this choice? In this section, we will dive into air travel trends, focusing on how external events have influenced travel behavior.

The number of passengers departing from Danish airports has generally increased, though with a few significant declines. One notable drop occured in 2009, possibly as a response to the Great Recession, the financial crisis from end-2007 to 2009. The most dramatic change occurred in 2020, when travel nearly collapsed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The industry has climbed back and in 2024 pre-pandemic numbers were reached.

<p style="text-align: center; color: #666; margin-top: -10px;">Average Monthly Departing Passengers for 2024</p>
The steady rise in passenger numbers over the 20-year period probably reflects Denmark’s economic growth: As incomes rose and businesses expanded, more people could afford to fly, and companies likely increased international travel for meetings and expansion.

This data highlights how Danish air travel has grown over time but remains vulnerable to external event, with the pandemic leaving a particularly lasting mark.

### Montly travelling patterns

The plot above clearly highlights a cyclical nature in air travels. To gain a deeper understanding of these fluctuations, we calculated the average number of passengers per month over the 20-year period. This allowed us to capture a clearer picture of these trends and the results are plotted below.

Passenger traffic consistently spikes in the summer months (June-August) reflecting vacation travel and holiday visits. While the sharp decline in 2020-2021 could impacted the distribution, particularly in March, the +20-year average probably secure that it doesn't significantly distort the overall trends.
