## Analyzing Danish Travel Spending Categories

This analysis explores how the three main travel spending categories—restaurant dining, accommodation, and travel packages—distribute across different demographic dimensions in Denmark. Using radar visualizations, we can directly compare spending patterns and identify key trends.

## Socioeconomic Group Comparison

The socioeconomic radar reveals distinct spending patterns:

- **Restaurant spending** (green) dominates across all socioeconomic groups, with high-income earners and self-employed Danes allocating the most to dining experiences.

- **Accommodation spending** (yellow) shows significant variation between groups, with self-employed travelers and high-income earners investing substantially more than students and pensioners.

- **Package travel** (purple) creates the smallest footprint but is more evenly distributed, showing less dramatic socioeconomic variation than other categories.

The overall pattern shows a clear socioeconomic gradient, with spending increasing from students and unemployed Danes through to high-income earners. Self-employed travelers display a distinctively strong accommodation emphasis, suggesting a preference for quality lodging during their travels.

## Age Group Comparison

The age-based visualization demonstrates how travel preferences evolve throughout life:

- **Restaurant spending** (green) forms a distinctive pattern that peaks in middle age (40-49) and gradually declines in older age groups.

- **Accommodation spending** (yellow) reaches its highest point in the 60-69 age bracket, corresponding with early retirement and suggesting increased investment in comfort during travel.

- **Package travel** (purple) shows a clear increase with age, with older demographics allocating significantly more to organized travel experiences than younger Danes.

The radar pattern confirms the life-arc of travel spending, expanding across all categories through middle age, peaking in early retirement years (60-69), and moderately contracting in the over-70 group.

## Regional Variation

The regional radar highlights geographical spending patterns:

- **Capital Region (Hovedstaden)** residents outspend other regions across all categories, particularly in restaurant expenditures.

- **Restaurant spending** (green) shows the most regional variation, while package and accommodation spending display more consistent patterns nationwide.

- All regions maintain similar proportional allocation despite differences in total spending, suggesting consistent travel priorities throughout Denmark.

The visualization confirms the "Capital Region premium" in travel spending while demonstrating that regional differences primarily affect spending amount rather than category priorities.

## Key Insights from Category Analysis

This visualization approach reveals four fundamental patterns in Danish travel spending:

1. **Restaurant Primacy**: Dining consistently forms the largest spending category across all demographic dimensions, confirming its central role in Danish travel experiences.

2. **The Accommodation Spectrum**: Accommodation spending shows the widest socioeconomic variation, suggesting it serves as a key differentiator in travel styles based on income and occupation.

3. **The Package Age Gradient**: Package spending increases steadily with age, revealing evolving travel preferences throughout the lifecycle.

4. **Socioeconomic vs. Regional Variation**: Spending patterns vary dramatically across socioeconomic groups but remain relatively consistent across regions, suggesting economic status influences travel style more strongly than geographical location.

These patterns provide valuable insights for the travel industry in targeting different demographic segments with appropriate offerings based on their distinctive spending profiles.
