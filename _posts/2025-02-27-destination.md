As Danes pack their bags and head off to foreign destinations, one might wonder: why not spend their holidays in Denmark? This question was explored in a survey conducted by VisitDenmark as part of their comprehensive 2024 “Image and Potential Analysis.” The key reasons and they proportion of answers are visualized in the graphic below.

The results suggest that Danes are not so much rejecting Denmark as they are actively choosing what the world beyond has to offer. The most common and third most common reasons cited (“I want to experience a different culture in my vacations” and “I want to experience a different nature than what's in Denmark”) reveal a curiosity for culture and nature not possible to fulfill in Denmark. 

Some responses are more directly tied to Denmark itself, with a sense of dissatisfaction. For example, “The weather in Denmark is too unstable” and “It feels too much like everyday life to vacation in Denmark” highlight the Danes' perceived limitations of domestic travel.

## Throw the Dart: Where to go?
Now that we have uncovered why Danes choose to vacation abroad, let’s explore where they go. The visualization below illustrates the most popular travel destinations among Danes in 2023 as a percentage of the total amount of holiday trips. You can interact with the visualization by clicking on a continent to dive deeper.

Spain stands out as the unrivaled favorite, attracting 18% of all Danish holidays — and for good reason. It offers the cultural richness, more stable and warmer climate, and scenic diversity that many Danes seek, as highlighted in the previous analysis. Italy follows ticking many of the same boxes. Additionally both countries offer delicious cusines and are only a few hours away by plane. 

Overall, Europe accounts for 86% of Danish holidays emphasizing a strong regional preference likely driven by ease of travel, affordability, and familiarity with European destinations. Countries like France, Greece, Germany, Sweden and Norway also attract significant numbers of Danish travelers.

Outside of Europe, Asia is the second most visited continent, with Thailand, Japan, and India as leading destinations. These countries offer more exotic experiences, cultural diversity and warmer weather also in months where it is cold in Denmark.

On the other hand, North and South America have fewer Danish visitors. Possible reasons could include longer travel times, higher costs and perhaps a lower perception of value for short holidays. Nonetheless, the USA and Brazil stand out as key exceptions. 

## Culture Abroad, Leisure at Home

Lastly, it’s insightful to compare the types of activities Danes engage in while vacationing within Denmark versus abroad. The chart below presents the proportions of respondents who participated in each of nine key activity categories.

        style="width: 100%; height: 650px; border: none; overflow: hidden;"></iframe>
The data reveals a notable trend: Danes appear more culturally engaged when abroad. Activities like visiting historical attractions, buildings, and sights as well as museums and exhibitions account for nearly 50% of international vacation activities, but drop to about 41% when traveling domestically. Similarly, trying local food is a much more prominent part of the experience abroad.

Contrary, leisure and entertainment-focused activities are more common at home. Experience centers, amusement parks, and water parks see higher participation rates within Denmark. This likely reflects the popularity of destinations such as Tivoli, Legoland, and Lalandia, which are optimal for more family-oriented trips.

The comparison highlights a clear distinction: Abroad, Danes seek culture and exploration, while at home, they lean toward fun and relaxation.

<p>Danes prefer Southern Europe for its culture, sun, and cuisine, and while they seek cultural experiences abroad, their domestic vacations tend to focus more on leisure and family fun.</p>
