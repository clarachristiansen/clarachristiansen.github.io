<h3>Key Data Insights</h3>
<p>Cost factors move together strongly—correlation coefficients above 0.9 show that cheap destinations are affordable across the board. There's an interesting trade-off between safety and cost, with a moderate negative correlation suggesting slightly more affordable destinations sometimes have lower safety ratings. Climate patterns reveal that warmer destinations often have higher CO2 flight costs but lower living expenses, creating value opportunities for Danish travelers seeking sunshine.</p>

## Smart Recommendations

Eastern European countries like Poland, Czech Republic, and Hungary deliver excellent value—typically 30-40% cheaper than Denmark—while offering rich cultural experiences within short flights from Copenhagen. For winter escapes, Portugal and Spain provide warm temperatures, reasonable costs, and high safety ratings.

Given Danish travelers' documented passion for restaurant spending, cities like Barcelona and Berlin offer world-class dining at significantly lower prices than Copenhagen. Since restaurant costs correlate strongly with overall living expenses, budget-friendly countries typically mean great dining value too.

For safety-conscious travelers, Nordic neighbors like Finland and Iceland rank among the world's safest while offering unique landscapes. However, many affordable Eastern European destinations also maintain strong safety ratings while delivering better value.

## Finding Your Match

Use the map strategically: climate seekers should check temperature layers while considering flight emissions; value travelers can compare cost of living with local purchasing power; food enthusiasts can examine restaurant markers for vibrant culinary scenes.

The data's correlation patterns help predict overall affordability—if one cost metric is low, others likely are too. Look for destinations where multiple positive factors converge: moderate costs, good safety, pleasant climate typically create the best experiences.
